# Delivery-Tracker

Enhanced Driver Route Analyzer:

Overview:
The Enhanced Driver Route Analyzer is a Java application designed to manage and analyze driver route data. It extends the functionality of a previous program to handle more than 20 drivers and additional delivery points. The application reads driver route data, calculates route areas, and organizes this information using linked lists. It supports searching and sorting based on different criteria.

Files in the Repository:
Main.java: The main program that orchestrates reading input, processing data, and user interaction.
Driver.java: Represents a driver, including their name and route area, and implements the Comparable interface for sorting.
LinkedList.java: A generic linked list implementation used to manage and sort driver data.
Node.java: Represents a node in the linked list, designed to hold data of any type that implements Comparable.
driver.txt: Input file containing raw driver route data in a specific format.
cmd.txt: A text file (possibly for commands or test cases) related to sorting and querying the data.

Functionality:
Data Processing: Reads driver data from driver.txt, calculates the area of each route, and stores this information.
Linked List Management: Utilizes custom linked list structures to manage and organize driver data.
Sorting and Searching: Supports sorting (e.g., by area or name) and searching for specific drivers or criteria.

Usage:
1. Compile the Java files in the repository.
2. Run the compiled Main class.
